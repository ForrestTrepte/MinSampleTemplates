# MinSampleTemplates

Minimal starter templates for scratch experiments.

This is something I use for personal projects so that I can quickly try something out, reproduce a bug, create a small example, etc.

Each folder is a separate project based on a particular technology, such as a console app, Unity, or a Bonsai Simulator.
